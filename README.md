## Predicting House Sale Prices with Regression and Classification Models

This project was completed with a "full stack" real estate company in mind. This imaginary company would own the entire process of buying and selling homes. To ensure they make as much money as possible, it would be important for them to know what features of a home create the greatest sales prices, and using data analysis they can better understand the value of different improvements. 

This project uses the [Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
